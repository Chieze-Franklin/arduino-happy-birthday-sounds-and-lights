This is a very simple Arduino program that sings the classic "Happy Birthday to You" with a buzzer and LEDs.

I will try to include a better circuit diagram, but for now:
* Connect the negative of the buzzer to ground and the positive of the buzzer to pin 9.
* Connect the shorter legs of the LEDs to ground, via a 330 ohmns resistor.
* Connect the longer legs of the LEDs to pins 2, 3, 4, 13.
* Connect the positive of the board to 5v.

Hopefully the videos will make the circuit arrangement clearer.
